# MATRIX

*  a matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular array or table of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns, which is used to represent a 
   mathematical object or a property of such an object.
   
* For an example,

  is a 2X3 Matrix.
  
* matrices represent linear maps, and allow explicit computations in linear algebra. Therefore, the study of matrices is a large part of linear algebra, and most 
  properties and operations of abstract linear algebra can be expressed in terms of matrices. For example, matrix multiplication represents composition of linear 
  maps.  
  
* An inverse matrix is represented by,
  
  A^-1 = adj(A) / det(A)
